#-Back-merges the release into 'develop'

git push origin --tags

#Hot fixes

#git flow hotfix start

#The version argument hereby marks the new hotfix release name. Optionally you can specify a basename to start from.

#Finish a hotfix
#By finishing a hotfix it gets merged back into develop and master. Additionally the master merge is tagged with the hotfix version.
git flow hotfix finish VERSION
